# note_app

`note_app` is a simple note-taking application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. The application is written in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `ttkbootstrap` for a modern look and feel. Notes are stored in a `notes.json` file in JSON format, making it easy to save and load data between sessions.

## Features:

- Add new notes.
- View the content of a note by clicking its title.
- Edit existing notes.
- Delete notes.
- Save and load notes from a JSON file.
- A list to manage and store note titles.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with Python standard library)
- `ttkbootstrap` (installable via pip)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
```

## Running the Application

1. Download or clone the source code to your local directory.
2. Run the `note_app.py` file:

```bash
python note_app.py
```

The application window will open, and you can start creating and managing your notes!
